### Allow me to introduce myself

** SKILLS **
开头要记得打招呼。Good morning! It is really my honor to have this opportunity for an interview, and I hope I can make a good performance today.（早上好，很荣幸有这个面试的机会，希望我今天的表现能让大家满意。）
随后开始进行自我介绍。Now I will introduce myself briefly.（让我简单地介绍一下我自己。）或者你可以说Let me tell you a bit about myself.（让我简单说说我自己。）在进行自我介绍时，首先要交代基本情况，如年龄、故乡和学历。My name is Mary and I am 26 years old. I come from Shanghai, and I have just got my master degree from XXX University. I have been studying psychology for 6 years and I think it is fun.（我叫Mary，今天26岁。我来自上海，刚从XXX大学获得硕士学位。我学习心理学已经有六个年头，我觉得非常有意思。）如果是做正规的笔头自我介绍，要记得少用缩略符号“'”，例如I am 26 years old不要写成I'm 26 years old. 因为没有缩略的文字显得更加正式。

面试官可以看到你在简历上提供的信息，但是对于你的性格特点却不见得熟悉。简单说一说自己的性格和业余生活，有助于让面试官觉得你适合整个公司的氛围。I am open-minded, quick in thought and fond of history. In my spare time, I have broad interests like reading books, especially books related to historical events.（我的性格很开朗，反应灵敏，并且喜欢历史。在空闲时间，我有许多爱好，比如读书，尤其是有关于历史事件的书籍。）最后可以主动介绍一下自己的长处，提升面试官对你的印象。I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I feel a real sense of accomplishment when I finish a job that turns out just as I’d planned. I’ve set some high goals for myself. For example, I want to graduate with highest distinction. And even though I had a slow start in my freshman year, I made up for it by doing an honor’s thesis.（我认为我最大的优点是能够执着地尽力把事情办好。当做完一件工作而其成果又正合我的预想时，我会有一种真正的成就感。我给自己定了一些高目标。比如说，我要成为出色的毕业生。尽管在大学一年级时我启动慢了些，但最终我以优等论文完成了学业。）以上就是英语中自我介绍的大致内容，你也可以根据自己的特点进行适当的增减获得个性化的效果。

面试过程中求职者心情往往都很紧张，既要想着自己的每一句话怎么说，同时还要留心面试官下个问题是什么。有时候因为紧张中文说起来都不太流畅，用英语介绍就更容易出现问题，因为稍不注意就会有语法错误出现。下面为大家提供一篇IT英语面试自我介绍例文供参考。

　I am a third year master major in automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, P. R. China. With tremendous interest in Industrial Engineering, I am writing to apply for acceptance into your Ph.D. graduate program.
　　Education background
　　In 1995, I entered the Nanjing University of Science & Technology (NUST) -- widely considered one of the China’s best engineering schools. During the following undergraduate study, my academic records kept distinguished among the whole department. I was granted First Class Prize every semester,In 1999, I got the privilege to enter the graduate program waived of the admission test.
　　At the period of my graduate study, my overall GPA(3.77/4.0) ranked top 5% in the department. In the second semester, I became teacher assistant that is given to talented and matured students only. This year, I won the Acer Scholarship as the one and only candidate in my department, which is the ultimate accolade for distinguished students endowed by my university. Presently, I am preparing my graduation thesis and trying for the honor of
　　Excellent Graduation Thesis.
　　Research experience and academic activity
　　When a sophomore, I joined the Association of AI Enthusiast and began to narrow down my interest for my future research. With the tool of OpenGL and Matlab, I designed a simulation program for transportation scheduling system. It is now widely used by different research groups in NUST. I assumed and fulfilled a sewage analysis & dispose project for Nanjing sewage treatment plant. This was my first practice to convert a laboratory idea to a commercial product.
　　In retrospect, I find myself standing on a solid basis in both theory and experience, which has prepared me for the Ph.D. program. My future research interests include: Network Scheduling Problem, Heuristic Algorithm research (especially in GA and Neural network), Supply chain network research, Hybrid system performance analysis with Petri nets and Data Mining.
　　
　　### Common problems in English interview
　　
　　一般有这些：
1.家庭，成长环境。
2.教育背景，专业优势，人格魅力。
3 参加或组织过的活动。
4 你对这份工作的认识以及工作态度。


1. What is important to you in a job?
  Mention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, t
he feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.

  2. Why do you want to work for this organization?
  Cite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working condit
ions. Stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organ
ization.

  3. Why should we employ you?
  Point to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm. Mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. If the job involves management responsibilities, refer to past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team.

  4. If we hire you, how long will you stay with us?
  Answer by saying along these lines: "As long as my position here allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities."

  5. Can we offer you a career path?
  Reply: "I believe you could, once I know the normal progression within the organization. Can you tell me about it?" The answer may be revealing.

  6. What are your greatest strengths?
  Give a response like one of the following: "I can see what needs to be done and do it", "I'm wiling to make decisions", "I work well with others," "
I can organize my time efficiently."

  7. What are you greatest weakness?
  Identify one or two, such as the following:" I tend to drive myself too
hard", " I expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " I like to se
e a job done quickly, and I'm critical if it isn't." Note these weaknesses c
ould also be regarded as desirable qualities. The trick with this question i
s to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.

  8. What didn't you like about previous jobs you've held?
  Discuss the things you didn't like, but avoid making slighting reference
to any of your former employers.

9. How do you spend your leisure time?
  Mention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.

  10. Are there any weaknesses in your education or experience?
  Take stock of your weaknesses before the interview. Practice discussing them in a positive light. You'll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer.

  11. Where do you want to be five years from now?
  Saying that you'd like to be president is unrealistic, yet few employers want people who are content to sit still. You might say, "in five years, I'd like to have my boss's job. " If you can't qualify for your boss's job by then, you may not be the fright candidate.

  12. What are your salary expectations?
  If you are asked this at the outset, it's best to say, "Why don't we discuss salary after you decide whether I'm right for the job? "But if the interviewer asks this after showing real interest in you, speak up. She or he will probably try to meet your price. If you need a clue about what to ask for, say, " Can you discuss your salary range with me?"

  13. What would you do if....?
  This question is designed to test your reposes. For example: "What would
you do if your computer broke down during an audit?" Your answer there isn't nearly so important as your approach to the problem. And a calm approach is best. Start by saying, "One thing I might do is ..." Then give several alternative choices.

  14. What type of position are you interested in?
  Job titles and responsibilities vary from firm to firm . So state your skills instead, such as "I'm good at figure work," and the positions that req

 15. Tell me something about yourself.
  Say you'll be happy to talk about yourself, and ask what the interviewer
wants to know. If this point is clarified, respond. If not, tell why you feel your skills will contribute to the job and the organization. This question gives you a great opportunity to sell yourself.

  16. Do you have any questions about the organization or the job? Employers like a candidate who is interested in the organization. so this is a perfect time to convey your interest and enthusiasm

面试的最后需要做些什么?
关于真正的面试最后要提醒的是：结束面试时要说：“我对这份工作非常感兴趣，我下一步要干些什么？”朋友，你是否在热切地盼望着？如果聘用你，那将是他们的幸运！
　　One last great tip about the actual interview: Always end the interview with, “I am very interested in the position. What are the next steps to take?” Boy, are you eager? They’d be lucky to have you!

准备好你要提出的问题
        在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先，不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。这里有风个备选问题：
　　请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？
　　
考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。
　　Have questions of your own. Toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” Do you have any questions for me? You must have questions. First, don’t rush into your answer. Look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. Here is a handful of potential questions:

　　How would you describe a typical workday?/What is the best part of working at this company for you? /Are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/Why did you join the company?
　　Interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.

常见问题做好准备

针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案：
谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？/ 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历和大学活动与这份工作有何关联?

最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职，参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。
Have answers ready for these popular interview questions:

Tell me a little about yourself./What interests you most about this position?/Where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/What is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./What are your greatest strengths?/What did you like about your last job?/What separates you from other candidates?/How do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work?

Most importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. Think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. Then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)The problem you encountered,2)How you analyzed it, and 3)The solution you implemented.

面试中的“陷阱”问题

　　序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”，那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。
　　第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么，都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢：“我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。”

   The best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. If interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. But if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“Hey, I enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.

  　First is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. The trap question is some variaton on“ What is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ What is your area of weakness?” The real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. Whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. Instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. For example: “I prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. I sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ Sometimes I have a hard time saying no to people, and I end up taking on more than my share of work.” If you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “I’m a perfectionist. I need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure I get everything right. ”

为何要离开你以前的公司

　　对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题（以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。
　　Be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. These questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“Why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“It was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.

面试难题的应答策略 （上）
　　求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。
一、你来这里能干什么？
　　对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略：
1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。
2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。
3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。
4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。
5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。
二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？

　　用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略：
1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因：
（a）专业对口；
（b）公司有发展；
（c）工作环境优越；
（d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"；
（e）有更多到外国工作的机会；
（f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣；
（g）离家近；
（h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染）
2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。
3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。
面试难题的应答策略 （下）
三、你自认为有什么优缺点？
　　主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人，往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出，那就不适合做某项工作。
答问策略：
1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这类问题就不知如何是好了。
2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。
3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。
4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有，又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己：
对应聘有利的优点：
--好学习、肯钻研。
--脑子好使，记忆力强。
--办事认真，一丝不苟。
--有干劲，不惜力。
--好相处，跟谁都合得来。
--有比较丰富的阅历。
--喜欢接受挑战性的课题。
--不交女友（男友）不成家。
对应聘有利的缺点：
--有名利思想：
（a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。
（b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。
（c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待，克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。）
--急脾气
（a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。
（b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。
（c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！
--有时主观：
（a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。
（b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。
（c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。
--不拘小节：
（a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。
（b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。
（c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。）
--抠门儿、吝啬：
（a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。
（b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！（该人适合管理财务工作）。
（c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。
--害羞、胆小：
（a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。（该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作）
（b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。
（c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。）
--不顾家：
（a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。
（b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。"所以，我不是一个好丈夫。
（c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。
5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。
四、你善于与什么人相处?
　　主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、促销等任务。答问策略：
1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。
2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。
3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位，就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。
4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。
五、你为什么经常想调动工作？
　　主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因，是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略：
1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。
2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有：
（a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）；
（b）跟原单位的领导不和；
（c）想多挣钱；
（d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。
3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）：
（a）能实现个人的抱负；
（b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展；
（c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。

这里只是几个常见的英文面试问题，以供参考，多见于外企
      What Are Your Weaknesses?
      This is the most dreaded question of all. Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.”

   Why Should We Hire You?
    Summarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be a great addition to your team.”

   Why Do You Want to Work Here?
      The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.”

   What Are Your Goals?
    Sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.”

   Why Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job?
      If you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.”
      If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.”

   When Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job?
      The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.”

   What Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t?
    What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102 rmation to be more user-friendly.”

   What Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You?
      It’s time to pull out your old per&＃102 rmance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.”

   What Salary Are You Seeking?
      It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?”

   If You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be?
      Interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get the job done? What impression do you want to make?

Case One
Interviewer: I'd like to know the salary you expect.
我想了解一下，你期望的薪水是多少？
Applicant: My salary requirement may be too high, and I hope my primary will not be lower than RMB 4,000. First, I think I am an excellent graduate. Though there will be a transition period, I will soon make profits for the company. What's more, I think if a company is willing to pay a high salary for a post, it also indicates its importance. And only in this situation can I be convinced that I can get more learning opportunities and better prospects.
我的薪酬要求可能偏高，我希望我的起薪不低于4000元。首先我认为自己是一名优秀的大学毕业生，虽然刚到企业需要一段过渡期，但很快我就能为企业创造价值。而且，我也认为,一个企业如果可以开出较高的薪水，可以证明企业对这个职位的重视度。在这样的情况下，我才有信心能从企业获得更多的学习机会和更好的发展机遇。
Case Two
Interviewer: I'd like to know your salary expectations.
我想了解一下，你期望的薪水是多少？
Applicant: Since I am a recent graduate , there will be a transition period after I enter the company. So at the beginning, the profits I make for the company will be limited and I don't have specific requirements. But man has to survive. So I hope the salary will be enough to help me to be economically independent from my parents.
因为我是一个刚毕业的大学生，进入企业将有一段时间的适应期，一开始为企业创造的价值有限，所以我对薪金没有特定的要求。但人总是要生存的，所以，我希望我的薪金能够让我独立，在经济上不再依赖父母。
面试：如何回答工作期望问题工作期望是面试中一个必问问题之一。通常面试官都会问你想从工作中的到什么，或是你三到五年内的计划。那么，该如何回答这样的问题呢？下面两个案例会给你一点启示。
Case One
Interviewer: What do you want most from your work?
你最希望从工作中得到什么?
Applicant: I hope to get a kind of learning, to get skills from my work. Though I have studied in school for nearly 16 years, I have only learned knowledge. In the university, I got no chance to see real life and didn\'t get working skills. So I want to learn some working skills and become a professional in an industry.
我最希望得到的是一种学习，能让我学到工作的技能。虽然我已经在学校学习了快16年,但只是学习到了知识，在学校里，没有机会接触到真正的社会，没有掌握一项工作技能，所以我最希望获得一项工作的技能，能够成为某一个行业领域的专业人士。
Interviewer: Why did you choose us?
你为什么选择到我们公司来应聘?

Applicant: As the saying goes, "well begun is half done". Your company is a famous one in the industry and boasts a high reputation. I hope to choose your company as the beginning of my career. I can not only learn new things, but set a solid foundation for my future career as well.
俗话说"良好的开端是成功的一半"。贵公司是行业内的知名公司，享有很高的声誉。我希望选择贵公司作为事业的开端，不仅可以学到新东西，而且为我将来的发展打下良好的基础。
Case Two
Interviewer: What do you hope this job will give you?
你最希望这份工作给予你什么?
Applicant: I hope this job will give me a chance to take responsibility. In more than ten years' of study as a student, I have never taken any responsibility in any real sense or earned money for a company. I think people can only become mature by taking on responsibility. I hope this work will give me the chance to develop fully.
我希望这份工作可以给我一个承担职责的机会。在过去十几年的学习生涯中，作为一名学生，我从来没有在真正意义上承担过责任，为一个企业盈利。我认为，人是通过承担一定的责任才能成长、成熟的，我希望这份工作能够给予我发展的机会。
以上例子从学习和承担职责的角度出发，都十分注重能力的培养，这会让面试官觉得求职者不是一个功利心很强的人，给面试官留下好印象。
面试：如何应对角色扮演的问题
角色扮演是各大外企招聘时经常采用的方式之一。回答这类问题的要点是应聘者一定要设身处地、把自己当作角色中的人物。另外，基于任何角色提出的问题根本的目的是要考察应聘者对公司的态度，所以在角色扮演时，要把自己想象成该角色，也要站在全公司的角度来考虑问题，所谓大处着眼、小处着手，方能立于不败之地。
Case One
Interviewer: You are a director of our company and you are in charge of a project. There are six people in the project team. Due to different opinions, the team is split into two parts at a meeting and they are debating ferociously. At this time, as a leader, what will you do to coordinate the two parts? If the two parts disagree, what will you do then?
如果你已经成为我公司的一名主管，由你负责管理一个项目。在该项目的团队中一共有六个人。在一次会议上，由于观点不同，团队分成两派，,进行了激烈的争论，这时，你作为领导者该如何协调？如果两方不能达成共识，你又会怎么办？
Applicant: First, I will listen to both sides carefully, and make my own judgment. If I prefer one side, I will give facts and data to persuade the other side. If my opinion is between the two sides, I will also give facts and data to prove my opinion right. It is better that the two sides will agree on it. If not, I will stick to my opinion and allow the colleagues who keep reserved opinions to give more data and communicate with me. In short, my principle is that everything should be based on data and facts. Every colleague has the right to express his opinion. I will try my best to make all people agree on one thing. If I fail, I will make my decision, as a leader.
首先我会仔细聆听双方的观点和理由，并作出我的判断。如果我倾向于其中一方的观点，我会拿出数据和事实来说服另一方；如果我的观点是介于两者之间，我同样会基于数据和事实来证明我的立场。如果最后大家能够达成共识自然最好。如果不能，我会坚持我的观点，但允许持保留意见的同事拿出更多的数据来和我沟通。总之，我的原则是，用数据和事实说话，每一位同事都有权表达他的观点，我会尽量让大家达成共识。如果不行，那作为领导者，我会做出一个决定。
点评：该求职者能够基于数据和事实说话，既不是独断专行，也不做和事老，这充分表现了他处理问题的成熟程度。
Case Two
Interviewer: You are now a team member and if your leader has made a decision but you don't quite agree with this decision and other members don't express any special opinions, what will you do?
如果你现在是一个项目的团队成员，如果你的领导已经作出了一个决定，但你个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，那你会怎么做？
Applicant: If my leader has made a decision, but I myself don't quite agree with this decision and other members don't express any special opinion, I will still express my opinion. If the leader doesn't agree with me, I will make my own judgment. If this decision isn't very important, then as a team member, I will act according to what the leader has decided. If this is a key decision, I will gather related information to support my view and try to persuade my leader.
如果我的领导已经做出了一个决定，但我个人对这个决定不十分赞同，而其他的成员没有表达特别的意见，这时候问我仍然会提出我的意见。如果领导不同意，那我会做出自己的判断。如果我们这个决定并不是十分重要的，那么作为团队成员，我会遵照领导的决定来执行；如果是一个关键的决定，我会搜集相关的材料为我自己的观点寻找支持，力求说服领导。
点评：虽然只是一个团队成员，但该求职者仍然能够大胆地提出自己地意见，并且能够就问题做出理性的判断，能够让面试官觉得该求职者是真正站在公司的立场上看待问题，并且体现了他处理问题的成熟性。

到外企应聘如何准备英文RESUME

 　　一份出色的Resume，是向外企求职的关键之一。不了解有关的常识和程式，不花费相当的心思来展示，以有纯正娴熟的英文功底，决不能获得单位的青睐。在一大堆错误百出、英文表达能力低劣或平庸，毫无针对性和创造性的Resume中，你的那份若能让人眼睛一亮，成功的机会必将大大增加，以下试着结合一个具体的例子给出说明和评述。
　　Balance Sheet：
　　基本方法选取适当的工作后，必须看清招聘广告上所列出的每项要求，再将自己的学历、能力与兴趣逐一与之比较，作一张balance sheet.
　　例如，一则关于marketing management trainee和job requirement是这样写的：
　　We are looking for a competent person to fill the captioned position：
　　University graduate majors in Marketing Management. Prepared to develop career in the commercial field
　　-outgoing personality
　　-Able to communicate with different levels
　　-Good knowledge in PC operations -Proficiency in written and spoken English/Mandarin
　　则你相应地考虑自己的qualification的选择和表述，如你可写（与上列各项对应）：
　　-University graduate with major in Marketing
　　-Having actively participated in Business club‘s activities and learned accounting and management
　　-Good in communication with people and like a lot of out door activities know how to tackle with people from all walks of life
　　-Skillful in operating Words,Excel,Lotus1-2-3,etc
　　-Fluent in English and studied advanced level of Mandarin
　　这个方法的好处是可让求职者清楚了解该职位是否适合自己，而本身资料又是否切合要求，而且，明白了各项要求后，就可依据每一点在履历表上重点提出自己在该方面的强项。突出卖点(selling point)，将之放在最吸引别人的地方，使招聘者一眼可见，有利于present自己。
　　工作经验的陈述
　　工作经验是一份resume中令招聘者相当感兴趣的一项内容，善加措词是必不可忽视的要务。
　　刚毕业，何来工作经验？其实，客下读书时的兼职、实习、实践，以至所曾参加的一些课外活动－协助助出版学校刊物、举办活动，展览、宣传……都可算是工作经验、不过，表达起来要有针对性地展开，列出那些与所找工作有关连的项目重点介绍，必要时更可使用summary的方式，给招聘者深入的了解。

　　下面这份材料的相关表这实在简陋呆板：
　　1996/7-1996/8 General Clerk, IBM
　　1995/7-1995/8 Account clerks, Manley Toy Trading
　　1994/6-1994/8Salesgirl,Esprit.
　　倘能换一种表述如：
　　Three years of job experience in different positions have offered me opportunities to understand different job aspects.
　　-As a General Clerk(IBM),Accounts clerk (Manley Toy Trading),I have learned how to prepare purchasing orders, place orders, handle accounting mattery, check voucher,……also(Salesgirl, Esprin)developing the technique of sellina, serving and
stocking.
　　岂非能更好地突出个人工作经验，吸引招聘者的注意力！
　　Job Objective通常，一般求者只会在履历表开端简单地写上所应征的职位－"Position Applied: Management Trainee"或"I am appling for……"其实，若懂得利用这小小空间写出自己的事业目标（job objective），能显示出你对该工作的热诚及憧憬，能令招聘者对你加倍留意。
　　比如这个不错的例子job objective To begin as a Marketing Management Trainee, with opportunity to advance to executive level and contribute to the development of firm.
　　其实，这位外企人士所谈的关于准备RESUME的技巧，完全可以应用到中文简历上来。各位读者可以尝试一下。

求职面试的技巧
Tricks in Job Hunting Interview
 　　Here are good answers to some of the tougher questions asked in job interviews. If you can smoothly supply answers like these during the interview, you are bound to make a good impression.
1. What is important to you in a job?
Mention specific rewards other than a paycheck for example, challenge, the feeling of accomplishment, and knowing that you have made a contribution.
2. Why do you want to work for this organization?
Cite its reputation, the opportunities it offers, and the working conditions. Stress that you want to work for this organization, not just any organization.
3. Why should we employ you?
Point to your academic preparation, job skills, and enthusiasm about working for the firm. Mention your performance in school or previous employment as evidence of your ability to learn and to become productive quickly. If the job involves management responsibilities, refer to past activities as proof of your ability to get along with others and to work as part of a team.
4. If we hire you, how long will you stay with us?
Answer by saying along these lines: "As long as my position here allows me to learn and to advance at a pace with my abilities."
5. Can we offer you a career path?
Reply: "I believe you could, once I know the normal progression within the organization. Can you tell me about it?" The answer may be revealing.
6. What are your greatest strengths?
Give a response like one of the following: "I can see what needs to be done and do it", "I'm wiling to make decisions", "I work well with others," "I can organize my time efficiently."
7. What are you greatest weakness?
Identify one or two, such as the following:" I tend to drive myself too hard", " I expect others to perform beyond their capacities", " I like to see a job done quickly, and I'm critical if it isn't." Note these weaknesses could also be regarded as desirable qualities. The trick with this question is to describe a weakness so that it could also be considered a virtue.
8. What didn't you like about previous jobs you've held?
Discuss the things you didn't like, but avoid making slighting reference to any of your former employers.
9. How do you spend your leisure time?
Mention a cross section of interests-active and quiet, social and solitary -- rather just one.
10. Are there any weaknesses in your education or experience?
Take stock of your weaknesses before the interview. Practice discussing them in a positive light. You'll find that they are minor when discussed along with all the positive things you have to offer.
11. Where do you want to be five years from now?
Saying that you'd like to be president is unrealistic, yet few employers want people who are content to sit still. You might say, "in five years, I'd like to have my boss's job. " If you can't qualify for your boss's job by then, you may not be the fright candidate.
12. What are your salary expectations?
If you are asked this at the outset, it's best to say, "Why don't we discuss salary after you decide whether I'm right for the job? "But if the interviewer asks this after showing real interest in you, speak up. She or he will probably try to meet your price. If you need a clue about what to ask for, say, " Can you discuss your salary range with me?"
13. What would you do if....?
This question is designed to test your reposes. For example: "What would you do if your computer broke down during an audit?" Your answer there isn't nearly so important as your approach to the problem. And a calm approach is best. Start by saying, "One thing I might do is ..." Then give several alternative choices.
14. What type of position are you interested in?
Job titles and responsibilities vary from firm to firm . So state your skills instead, such as "I'm good at figure work," and the positions that require these skills , such as "accounts payable."
15. Tell me something about yourself.
Say you'll be happy to talk about yourself, and ask what the interviewer wants to know. If this point is clarified, respond. If not, tell why you feel your skills will contribute to the job and the organization. This question gives you a great opportunity to sell yourself.
16. Do you have any questions about the organization or the job?
Employers like a candidate who is interested in the organization. so this is a perfect time to convey your interest and enthusiasm.

面试的最后需要做些什么?
关于真正的面试最后要提醒的是：结束面试时要说：“我对这份工作非常感兴趣，我下一步要干些什么？”朋友，你是否在热切地盼望着？如果聘用你，那将是他们的幸运！
　　One last great tip about the actual interview: Always end the interview with, “I am very interested in the position. What are the next steps to take?” Boy, are you eager? They’d be lucky to have you!
准备好你要提出的问题

        在面试结束前，考官会俯身对你说：“你对我有什么问题要问吗？”这时，你必须提出问题。首先，不要急于提问，要显出　你在思考有些问题在问的样子，然后从你事先想的问题中选出一个合适的提问。这里有风个备选问题：
　　请您说说一个标准的工作日是什么样的。/ 对您来说，在这家公司荼好在哪里？/ 是否有充分机会参加一些讨论会、培训班，以了解公司的方方面面？/ 您为什么加入这家公司？
　　考官喜欢谈论他们自己，所以这些问题绝对会赢得他们的好感。
　　Have questions of your own. Toward the end of interview. the interviewer is going to lean into you and say,” Do you have any questions for me? You must have questions. First, don’t rush into your answer. Look as if you are thinking about whether you have any questions and then ask an appropriate one from the list you’ve thought about beforehand. Here is a handful of potential questions:
　　How would you describe a typical workday?/What is the best part of working at this company for you? /Are there significant opportunities to take seminars, classes to learn more about the different facets of the company?/Why did you join the company?
　　Interviewers love to talk about themselves, so these questions will win them over every time.
常见问题做好准备

针对以下通常的面试问题事先准备好答案：
谈一谈你自己的情况。/ 这个职位什么地方最吸引你？/ 设想一下今后5年、10年、20年你会在哪里？/ 你最终的职业目标是什么？/ 谈谈以前在工作中解决过的棘手问题。/ 你最大的优点是什么？/ 你对上一份工作有何感想？/ 你和其他应聘者的不同之处是什么？/ 你发前的经历、学历和大学活动与这份工作有何关联?
最重要的是你要把自己宣传成一个能解决问题的人。想一想你干过的工作，大学里做过的兼职，参加过的志愿者活动，或者你创建过的俱乐部。然后描述你是如何解决具体问题的。描述时要把经历分成三段：1.你所遇到的问题是什么？2.你是如何对它时行分析的3.你执行的解决方案是什么。
Have answers ready for these popular interview questions:
Tell me a little about yourself./What interests you most about this position?/Where so you see yourself in 5,10,20 years?/What is your ultimate career goal?/tell me about a project that had a tough problem that you solved./What are your greatest strengths?/What did you like about your last job?/What separates you from other candidates?/How do your previous experience/academic preparation and college activities relate to this work?
Most importantly, sell yourself as a problem solver. Think about the work you have done, the job you had in college, volunteer work you did, or the club that you founded. Then proceed to illustrate how you solved a particular problem by breaking that experience into three parts:1)The problem you encountered,2)How you analyzed it, and 3)The solution you implemented.
面试中的“陷阱”问题

　　序：在面试时，你能为考官所做的最好的事就是使他或她的工作变得轻松，如果考官在与你交谈后心中感到沉重的话，这对你很不利，但是，如果你们的交流留给他人这样一种感觉――“嘿，我喜欢这次交流”，那么你离得到这份工作就不远了。
　　第一种是“陷阱”问题，几乎在所有面试中都会出现。“陷阱”问题是指“你在哪些方面最需要改进”或者“你的缺点是什么”之类的问题。你真实的回答或许是你不拘小节，或者是你十分腼腆，但是无论你回答什么，都不要把你的个人缺点拿出来“分享”，相反，你要尽力找一个算不上是真正的缺点，甚至稍微接近理想化的个性特征来回答。譬如说，“我喜欢把一件工作从头干到尾，而不是只做其中的一个环节，而见不到完成的结果。如果不能经历工作的整个过程，我会觉得有点沮丧。”或者，“有时我很难拒绝别人的请求，结果就承担了许多份外的工作。”如果你实在想不出什么话好回答，你可以尝试以下这句经久不衰（尽管有些过时）的答谢：“我是个完美主义者。我所要改进之处是不要对自己太苛刻，并确信自己能把诸事外理妥当。”
   The best thin you can do for your interviewers is to make his/her job easier. If interviewers walk out after talking to you feeling like they carried the weight of the conversation, which is a strike against you. But if your exchange leaves them with a feeling of,“Hey, I enjoyed that,” that could move you that much closer to hearing that you got the job.

  　First is the trap question, which comes up in almost every interview. The trap question is some variaton on“ What is the area you need most improvement in? ”or“ What is your area of weakness?” The real answer may be that you have are lousy to attention detail or that you are incredibly shy. Whatever you do, don’t share your personal weaknesses. Instead, try to find something to say that isn’t a real weakness，but a slightly less-than-ideal characteristic. For example: “I prefer to see a project through from start to finish rather than working on a single component and never seeing the finished product. I sometimes find it a bit frustrating to work without that overall context.”“ Sometimes I have a hard time saying no to people, and I end up taking on more than my share of work.” If you really can’t think of anything to say, you can always go with this time-tesed (albeit cliched) comeback: “I’m a perfectionist. I need to improve on not being so hard on myself and making sure I get everything right. ”

为何要离开你以前的公司

　　对为何要离开你以前的公司而对新的公司产生兴趣之类的问题时，应该谨慎回答。 这样的问题（以及它们的答案）的意图在于证实你对新公司确有读音，而不是由于你被解雇或者在以前的工作岗位上犯了严重的错误。如果考官很尖锐地问你：“你为什么被解雇？”回答要简单扼要。譬如“那里的环境不和睦，许多人都被迫离开”就是个很好的回答。
　　Be on the lookout for questions about why you left your old company and why you are interested in the new one. These questions(or their offspring) are designed to make sure your interest in the new company is sincere and not due to you being fired and/or having the interviewer throws at you:“Why were you fired?”keep the answer simple and brief.“It was a hostile environment in which many people were let go,”is a good way to handle it.

面试难题的应答策略 （上）
　　求职面试时，一些问题让你听起来一下子不知如何作答，答也不好，不答也不好；多答也不好，少说了好像也不行。还有的问题你又会感到：不知从哪个角度作答更为有利或更为礼貌。以上这类问题，我们可以将其归纳为"面试难题"，逐一探讨一番，对求职面试的朋友，一定能有所帮助。
一、你来这里能干什么？
　　对这类咄咄逼人的难题，主试人提出其意图有二：一是怀疑、不信任这位求职者的学历、资历或经验并暗示不大可能录用；二是有意出此难题，以诱使对方尽可能地表白自己，从而更深入了解此人。答问策略：
1先从心理上要稳住，别慌乱，别气馁，别急着辩白。
2应把这类难题当成进一步申明这职位适合你的种种条件和理由，即我到这里能干什么工作。既要自信，又要实事求是。
3应聘前先要把自己的资历与经验和用人单位职位的条件一一分析清楚，列出种种适合的理由，这样在答问时就会慷慨陈词、条理井然了。
4不要长篇大论，能说清楚就够了。
5态度要不卑不亢，不要一听对方认为你干不了，你就乞求对方。因为用人单位不会因可怜谁就录用谁的。
二、你为什么有兴趣到这里找工作？
　　用人单位对某些学历、资历比较高的求职者常提类似的问题，其意图是：1怕这人将来"跳槽"，工作不安心，把新工作当成一块跳板。2进一步考验这种人，看他们有没有决心到这里来踏实工作。3多用反问句、设问句的口气提出，考察应聘者的态度变化。答问策略：
1应聘人听到这类提问应该推断出自己的条件还不错，用人单位可能出于担心自己不安心所致。所以要态度诚恳地指出有兴趣来此的原因：
（a）专业对口；
（b）公司有发展；
（c）工作环境优越；
（d）听朋友介绍这家公司的老板是"伯乐"；
（e）有更多到外国工作的机会；
（f）经常出差适合自己的兴趣；
（g）离家近；
（h）福利待遇特别好，等等。（只需点出即可，不必大加渲染）
2以比较坚决的口气表白自己如何喜欢这个部门并愿为它效劳。
3别忙中出错或言多语失。比如对方是一个台湾人开的公司，你却说："我很希望为泰国的公司工作，泰国是一个美丽的发展中国家。"这会让对方啼笑皆非的。

面试难题的应答策略 （下）
三、你自认为有什么优缺点？
　　主试人想通过这一类问题的解答了解到： 1这个人能否对自己做出正确的估价。因为不能估计自己的人，往往也不会正确地评价自己的工作；2主试人最关注的是该人的缺点、弱点，如这方面的问题比较突出，那就不适合做某项工作。
答问策略：
　
1参加面试前，应对个人的优点缺点有所认识，必要时听听家人或朋友的评价。千万不要一听对方问这类问题就不知如何是好了。
2最忌讳的是无所谓的态度，比如："我也没什么优点，也谈不上什么缺点，我这个人嘛，一般就是了！""谁还没个缺点？我有是有，可是一下子也讲不清楚，管它呢?quot;--这种回答，容易给人以玩世不恭的感觉，很难委以重要的职位。
3自己的优点、长处，缺点、短处都应老老实实地讲，态度越是诚恳、真挚，对方越对你有好感，不一定会减少聘用的机会。
4会讲话的人大都善于运用个人的优缺点把这篇大文章作好。下面，我们列出几条，你看自己有没有，又怎么利用它巧妙地介绍自己：
对应聘有利的优点：
--好学习、肯钻研。
--脑子好使，记忆力强。
--办事认真，一丝不苟。
--有干劲，不惜力。
--好相处，跟谁都合得来。
--有比较丰富的阅历。
--喜欢接受挑战性的课题。
--不交女友（男友）不成家。
对应聘有利的缺点：
--有名利思想：
（a）别人说我是个人主义、名利思想。
（b）别人认为我好出风头，追求名利地位。
（c）没名没利的事，我不大乐意干。（名利思想的另一面，是有所作为，不甘寂寞。只要认真对待，克服短处，可以从事开拓创新的工作。）
--急脾气
（a）工作要是干不好，我打心里起急，非得干好不成。
（b）谁要干活投机取巧，我老跟人家发脾气。
（c）遇到磨洋工的人，我就跟他急！
--有时主观：
（a）别人要说服我，可不容易了，你摆不出事实、证据来，我还是坚持个人的主见。
（b）我不会让人牵鼻子走，确实很主观。
（c）我有时会跟同事争，因为他们说服不了我，说我太主观了。
--不拘小节：
（a）我这个人，大事头脑清醒，可小事又不拘小节。
（b）我经常忽略一些小事，这是不细心的表现。
（c）您可别让我处理琐碎的事，我这人太不细心。（该人或许从事开拓性的工作较为合适。）
--抠门儿、吝啬：
（a）时代变了，我还是一分钱掰两半地花，招人讨厌。
（b）别人跟我吵，很多时候是嫌我管钱太死，说我"抠门儿到家"了。我就是老改不了！（该人适合管理财务工作）。
（c）单位里的年轻人给我起了一个难听的外号："吝啬鬼"，想来想去这是我的缺点。
--害羞、胆小：
（a）别人说我是"大姑娘"，害羞，见不得大世面，只能干些看摊的工作。（该人适合做文秘、打字员、保管员等工作）
（b）我这个人生来胆子小，别说违法的事，就连上班也不敢迟到，怕人家议论。
（c）许多事未经请示，我是绝对不敢干的。胆小怕事嘛。（胆小，未必是弱点。有些工作交给胆大的人去干，领导还真不放心呢。）
--不顾家：
（a）我这个人家庭观念太差，干起活来老是不顾家。
（b）我老婆老说我："你呀，脑子里只有公司，没有公馆（指住处）。""你干脆住在公司算了。"所以，我不是一个好丈夫。
（c）我不是一个事业、家庭两全的人物。脑子里只有事业，哪还有家庭？大家都像我这样可就麻烦了。
5在谈及个人的优缺点时，最好以一种自我反省的语气说才能给人以良好印象。
四、你善于与什么人相处?
　　主试人是出于某些职位、行业的特殊需要才提出类似问题的。通过提问，了解该人能否与同事沟通营造良好的办公环境，提高办公效率，能否对外打开局面，广为结识顾客群，以便更好地完成调查、促销等任务。答问策略：
1应聘者应以亲切、轻松的语气谈论此类话题，给人以通达、开朗、热情的印象。这印象本身就在说明你这个人很好相处。如果你的态度又拘谨、又严肃，倒证明你这个人不好相交。
2谈及领导问题时应格外慎重。对领导，不存在你喜欢不喜欢的问题，因为你不喜欢，人家仍然是领导。所以应当从领导与被领导的关系上谈论为好。
3老好人，好好先生--这种人跟谁都合得来。但某些行业(如警察、质检员等)或某些职位，就不适宜这种人干。所以谈话时，要想到这一点。
4如果是刚毕业的大学生或是其他刚走出校门的学生，回答这种问题讲些学校生活同学之间的交友事例就行了。
五、你为什么经常想调动工作？
　　主试人提出这类可能令你感到难堪、尴尬的问题，其意图有二：一是深入了解你申请新工作的内在动因，是嫌过去的工资低？还是本人能力差、表现不好而让人辞退？还是生性好动，老是这山望着那山高，哪儿都呆不住、呆不长？等等。而这些恰恰是所有用人单位最讨厌的地方。二是考察该人的工作态度和应变能力。答问策略：
1这类问题都是非常敏感的话题，答问时宜慎重思考、从容作答。
2问及为什么"跳槽"时，不宜强调的理由有：
（a）市场不景气，是随大溜被辞退的（主试人会想：为什么不把你留下来呢？）；
（b）跟原单位的领导不和；
（c）想多挣钱；
（d）想找离家近点的地方，等等。这类回答易使用人单位觉得你不是最好的职工，弄不好你会故伎重演，所以要小心对待。
3问及为什么"跳槽"时，比较有意思的理由（真有的话）：
（a）能实现个人的抱负；
（b）有更大的机会获得提升和发展；
（c）欣闻贵公司要扩展业务，想施展个人的才能以报效社会，等等。

这里只是几个常见的英文面试问题，以供参考，多见于外企

   What Are Your Weaknesses?

   This is the most dreaded question of all. Handle it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: “I am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very helpful.”

   Why Should We Hire You?

   Summarize your experiences: “With five years’ experience working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. I’m confident I would be a great addition to your team.”

   Why Do You Want to Work Here?

   The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you’ve given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For example, “I’ve selected key companies whose mission statements are in line with my &＃118;alues, where I know I could be excited about what the company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable choices.”

   What Are Your Goals?

   Sometimes it’s best to talk about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For example, “My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.”

   Why Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job?

   If you’re unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: “I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which included me.”

   If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: “After two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.”

   When Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job?

   The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an idea of your preferences. “I was very satisfied in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and their problems&＃59; that is an important part of the job for me.”

   What Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can’t?

   What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: “I have a unique combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down in&＃102;ormation to be more user-friendly.”

   What Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You?

   It’s time to pull out your old per&＃102;ormance appraisals and boss’s quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone else’s words: “My boss has told me that I am the best designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense of humor.”

   What Salary Are You Seeking?

   It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: “I am sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay someone with my background?”

   If You Were an Animal, Which One Would You Want to Be?

   Interviewers use this type of psychological question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer “a bunny,” you will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer “a lion,” you will be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get the job done? What impression do you want to make?

英文简历不完全攻略

经常看到有人发翻译简历的贴子。其实我个人认为简历的翻译并没有定式，可自由发挥。但是有一个原则关系到别人看了你的英文简历后对你的英文水平的第一印象，那就是简历中地用词，句子，表达方式等一定要地道。也就是说不能带有太多的所谓中式英语，让别人一看就觉得很不爽。
    最近我有幸得到一些老外（包括非英语国家）的简历，看了以后颇有收获，拿来共享心得。题目虽然是《完全攻略》，但时间仓促，难免有理解错误，或者不完整的地方还希望大家指正，补充。总的来说，看完这些英文简历给我的感觉是：与其把中文简历翻译成英文，还不如用英文再写一个简历。这样完全按照英文的思维方式和习惯作为出发点写出的简历才会更地道。
一、简历的结构
    首先，整个简历要分成若干部分：基本情况、自我介绍、教育经历、工作经历等等。这些部分如何分完全凭自己掌握。但是有些不内容是必不可少的。下面就列出我在这些简历上看到的栏目：
    我注意到大部分简历的最上方（标题的位置）都是求职者的姓名和联系方式。也有某些简历用名字作为标题，然后下面的位置写上了自己的求职意向或者联系方式。而有些则是把联系方式做成页眉的效果。和这种方式能让阅读者对此人的姓名联系方式和求职意向一目了然，可以提高效率，并且对求职者有比较深刻的印象。由此可见她们的共同点是：大多以姓名作为大标题，然后再显眼的地方注明联系方式和求职意向。
    接下来算是简历的正文。所有的简历都把教育经历放在首位。看来教育背景还是对方关注的首要问题。教育背景是按照时间倒序排列的，最近的放在最上面。有的是时间写在前面，紧跟学校、专业作为条目的标题，或者把学校、专业放前面，后面跟时间。标题下面是具体的介绍。
    然后是工作经历，格式和教育背景基本一致。某些简历在教育背景和工作经历之间还加上了学过的和专业相关的课程，培训班等。而在工经理后面还可以加上参加过的志愿者工作等。
    以上是简历中的重头戏。接下来的内容大多是自己掌握的技能，语言能力和计算机能力。有时还有个人爱好等更全面介绍自己的内容。
二、简历的用词翻译
    下面列出一些中英文对照（有的地方可以用多个英文单词表示，用 '|' 隔开，这里列出的只是简历中出现的，也许并不仅限于这些）：
     求职意向 ------- Objective
          Objective这个词在电脑游戏中出现的频率很高。一般是作为每关之前的任务介绍。直译就是目标、目的。如果有Objective，一般放在正文的第一栏。
     教育背景 --------Education | Education and Qualifications
          都用这个，background就不要加上了，有点中式英语的嫌疑。如果包含了一些认证培训之类的，可以写成 Education and Qualifications.
    个人介绍、自我评价  -------- PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS | SYNOPSIS
          SYNOPSIS这个词比较笼统，内容可以自由些，包括个人性格，目前状况等。
          PERSONALITY HIGHLIGHTS 偏重于介绍自己的优势、优点等。
     工作经历  ---------- Experience | Work(ing) Experience | JOB EXPERIENCE | EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE
          这些都是大同小异。也有个人用 EMPLOYMENT HIGHLIGHTS。
          我注意到有个人在Work Experience 的位置用了 Research Experience， 再细看内容才发现此人的经历都是研究性质的工作，包括在大学期间从事的一些研究。
     参加过的活动（包括校内） -------------- ACTIVITIES
          ACTIVITIES最普遍，所有的活动都包括了，比较好用。
              Campus Involvement & Activities 这里加上compus 那就仅限于在学校的。这里的 Involvement  我猜想指的是参加社团或者某个组织的这种长期的活动。而Activities则不限。
    荣誉、奖励 -------- Honors | Awards
        有些干脆就用 Honors & Awards
    剩下的一些
       技能 ----  Skills | Additional Skills
      爱好 -----  HOBBIES
     计算机技能  ------ Computer Skills   也可以作为Skills的一部分。
     志愿者经历 -----  VOLUNTEERING
  接下来介绍一下具体内容的翻译。
     流利使用某种语言： Fluent in XXX
     普通话： Mandarin Chinese
      熟悉......：Familiar with....
     精通....   ：proficient with |  Advanced Skills in.... |  Advanced Software User： （列出精通使用的软件名称）
     个人、人： individual （注意不要用person什么的）
     关于语言能力的： Daily Spoken （经常使用的）， Training Obtained（受过培训的---我想不仅限于语言能力）

三、总结
       这些简历给我的最大感受是，简练。没有废话，有些地方甚至省略掉主语例如： Activities: President of College Democrats，中文简历中一般会说“曾担任校学生会主席”，而你要死板的翻译成英文就很罗嗦：“ I've been the President of the Students' Union of the college” ，不如就说 “President of the Students' Union ”，能简单尽量简单，至于是校学生会，还是系学生会不必在乎，再说真的在乎的话面试的时候有机会的。而且语言简练不容易出错，何乐而不为。
      在碰到一些不太好翻译的词汇时，不用着急，可以自己创造，只要能正确表达出中文词汇的含义即可。毕竟两种语言之间不是映射表的关系。
     我看到一份简历在Education后面还加上了，Double Majors 和 Higher Level Course Work， 这样把突出的教育经历或者工作经历单独列出来，容易引起关注，是个好方法。
    总之，要做到简练，结构清楚，表达明确，不出现错误，就是一个合格的英文简历。

第六步：请求答复联系
　　如果单位领导同意了你的求职要求，你必然要请他和你联系，以便你及时做好准备，到用人单位应聘或报到。为准确起见，请求答复联系时你还应当提供你的通讯地址、邮政编码、电话号码、电子信箱等。本文答复联系的内容可作如下介绍：
　　If you agree with me, please write a letter to me or phone me. I live at No.1 Renmin Road,Suzhou city. My telephone number is 3654371.
第七步：表明感激之情
　　无论你的请求是否能够得到满意的答复，你给用人单位写信就是给对方添了麻烦，因此你应向对方表明感激之情。本文可这样来表明感激之情：
　　Thank you very much.
　　上述七步内容联成一个整体，再加上下面的信尾，就成为一封完整的求职信。

 2.Whatareyourthreegreateststrengths? 铁芸说回答这个问题的时候不可以含混不清，不可以只是简单回答“I’mreallyorganized,punctualandgetalongwellwithothers.”简洁、精炼、找到这个公司所看重的特长，是回答这个问题的关键。比如要应聘金融行业，可是说“Ithinkmythreestrongeststrengthsaredetails-oriental,patientandcautious.”但是如果应聘者是一个销售精英，可以说:“Ithinkmystrongeststrengthsareaggressive,hardworkingandcommunicative.”总之，需要考虑到应聘公司及职务的需要来选择表现自己的优势。 3.Whatareyourthreegreatestweaknesses? 铁芸强调，能够为公司增值永远是老板的最爱，老板都愿意找到一个了解、热爱工作，并能够为公司创造价值的员工。所以不要很诚实的把自己的毛病暴露出来，而是要策略的选择一些能够为自己加分的缺点。比如:“IamaperfectionistandIpayverymuchattentiontodetails.SometimesIamquitecaptious.” 4.Whyareyouinterestedinworkingforourcompany? 这个问题主要考察应聘者是否对这个工作进行了了解，或者是否真正有兴趣，所以需要围绕整个公司的具体情况，让面试官知道你很清楚这个公司的运营模式，以及对这项工作非常积极。因此不要以“Itseemedlikeagoodcareermove,”或是"Ihaven’tbeenabletofindanythingelseinteresting.”为开始。如果能有一些实际问题回答的话，就会更大的加分，铁芸建议应聘者可以这样:“Ireadanarticleinthenewspaperandwasveryimpressedby…”但是前提是你必须真的对这家公司作了研究，同时也要注意，不要让面试官觉得你是为了讨好面试官而言过其实，这样只会适得其反。 5.Whydidyouleaveyourlastjob? 跳槽的原因可能是上一份工作非常糟糕，但是面试并不是适合抱怨的场合。而且千万不要对现有或是过去的雇主或同事进行这样的评论：“Ididn’tagreewiththecompany’sdirection.”“Igotnorecognitionformywork.”“Mybosswastotallyunreasonable.”铁芸建议要从自身发展的角度出发来回答:“Ilovemylastjobandreallylearnedalotfromit,butIneedanewplatformandbiggerspacetomakemycareersuccessful.”总之，要让面试官知道，以前的公司在你的眼中并非一钱不值，你是怀着感激来评价他们的。 6.Ifwehireyou,howlongwillyoustaywithus?

 5 这个问题是要老板想知道你会不会像离开上一份工作那样很快的也离开这里，铁芸建议你可以这样回答:“Aslongasmypositionhereallowsmetolearnandtoadvanceatapacewithmyabilities.”这样就告诉老板，你是希望同公司一起成长，不会轻易的离开。 7.Tellmeaboutatimewhenyoufeltveryhardatyourpreviousjob. 听到这个问题，应聘者可能会有些摸不透面试官到底想知道什么，而不知道怎么回答。其实这个时候他是想知道你过去的工作中有过什么特别的例子，来展示你有解决各项复杂问题的能力。这时，最好能提前准备一张优秀的“成绩单”,上面清楚的表明你处理过的问题的列表，告诉他你有能力解决任何困难，这一点至关重要。 8.Doyouhaveanyquestionsforme? 这也是一个面试中经典的结束问题，测试应聘者是否真正对这份工作真正有兴趣与热爱，此时应该询问具体的问题以显示应聘者非常了解该公司，对未来的工作有很多的期待和好主意，充分表示热情。铁芸说，应聘者一定要提前准备很多有关这个公司具体情况的问题，最好能够涉及到他们业务上取得的成绩，比如说：“Ilearnedthatyourcompanyhasseentremendousgrowthinrecentyears.I’mkeentoknowhowyoumadesuchasuccess.”你需要表现出对这个公司浓厚的兴趣，到了这时，基本上一张聘书就到手了。 常用的一些词 Ihavebeeninvolvedwith...
